Machine Learning for Catalyst Design and Discovery
====

Snapshots: ML scripts for reproducibility

## Description

This is a set of scripts to generate results of our paper: Statistical Analysis and Discovery of Heterogeneous Catalysts Based on Machine Learning from Diverse Published Data (K. Suzuki, T. Toyao, Z. Maeno, S. Takakusagi, K. Shimizu, I. Takigawa)

## Note

The results are based on the following versions of related libraries. To reproduce the same outputs, you need these versions on anaconda3-5.0.1.

- sklearn: 0.19.1
- xgboost: 0.81
- pandas: 0.23.1
- numpy: 1.14.5
- scipy: 1.0.1
- matplotlib: 2.2.4
